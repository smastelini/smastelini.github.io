Hi! My name is Saulo Martiello Mastelini, a Brazilian :brazil: who has lived for 18 years in the countryside region of a small city called [Cândido de Abreu](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A2ndido_de_Abreu) in the state of Paraná, Brazil. Even though I only had daily internet access when I was 19, I fell in love with computer science :computer: and decided to pursue a career in this field. I moved to Londrina in 2012, and I got my bachelor's in Computer Science with honors in 2016 at the [State University of Londrina (UEL)](https://portal.uel.br/home/). My final project concerned a computer vision application for grading poultry meat :poultry_leg:. By that time, the researchers involved in the project and I wrote a [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S153751101530060X) :scroll: which is, to this date, one of my most cited works.

I started my Master's in 2016 at the same university. In the beginning, I intended to research computer vision :eyes:, in a time when deep learning had not still got the spotlight :flashlight:. My plans to automatically tune a local contrasting enhancing algorithm using particle swarm :duck: optimization didn't work out as I expected. So, I had to come up with an alternative action plan. My advisor at that time, [Sylvio Barbon Jr.](http://www.barbon.com.br/), introduced me to [multi-target regression (MTR)](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/widm.1157) problems and I'm so grateful that he did this :smile:. I had a passing knowledge of machine learning, and it suddenly became my main research interest! Good times :partying_face:! I will never forget the friendship I made and the plethora of things I learned at UEL. After a lot of study and research, Sylvio and I published a good number of papers about MTR. I also created a simple [toolkit in R](https://github.com/smastelini/mtr-toolkit) to benchmark MTR problems. At the end of my Master's, I learned about data streams :man_swimming: and online machine learning, and it felt like a natural path :motorway: to pursue from where I was research-wise.

In 2018, I moved to [São Carlos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C3%A3o_Carlos) to start my Ph.D. under the supervision of professor [André Carlos Ponce de Leon Ferreira de Carvalho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andr%C3%A9-carlos-ponce-de-leon-f-de-carvalho-151bb26) in the Institute of Mathematics and Computer Science (ICMC) from the [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/). My research is supported :dollar_banknote: by [FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/en). At ICMC, I once again found a wonderful and chaotic (in a good sense) workplace! I made a lot of new friends that I keep, in the same way as the ones from UEL, to this day.

My central research theme is online machine learning regression, primarily using decision trees :seedling: and rules :straight_ruler:. Specifically, my thesis goal :light_bulb: was to make existing online regressors more efficient regarding memory and running time while keeping their predictive performance! During my Ph.D., I started collaborating with the `scikit-multiflow` project and ended up becoming one of its maintainers. In 2020, the core developers from `scikit-multiflow` and `creme` joined forces to create [River](https://riverml.xyz) :ocean:! So, I am a proud founding member and maintainer of the to-go library on online machine learning in Python!

From February 2022 to September 2022, I lived in Europe :european_union: as a visiting researcher at [INESC-TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en)/[University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/up/en/WEB_BASE.GERA_PAGINA?p_pagina=home)! My goal at the time was to build :wrench: more efficient online k-Nearest Neighbor algorithms under a sliding-window regimen. The resulting paper concerning that research was published on Elsevier's Information Fusion!

I love dogs :dog:, reading :book:, playing guitar :guitar: and singing :musical_note:, doing some trekking :mountain: and spending time with people I love :heart:! I formulated some of my best ideas and proposals in a mountain or amidst trees :evergreen_tree:.
